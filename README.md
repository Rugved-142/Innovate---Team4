# **📂 Smart Waste Management & Recycling System**
**An AI-powered waste management solution that integrates deep learning, IoT, and biofuel generation for a smarter, greener city.**

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on **end-to-end waste collection, classification, and recycling** using AI-driven automation. The core idea is:
1. **Smart Waste Collection:** Optimizing waste collection routes based on demand.
2. **AI-Powered Segregation:** Using **deep learning-based image classification** to categorize trash into:
   - **Cardboard**
   - **Food Organics**
   - **Glass**
   - **Metal**
   - **Miscellaneous Trash**
   - **Paper**
   - **Plastic**
   - **Textile Trash**
   - **Vegetation**
3. **Recycling & Biofuel Generation:** Processing classified waste into **biogas, bioethanol, compost, bio-oil, syngas, and recyclable materials** using mathematical and chemical formulas.
4. **Future Scope:** Integration with **IoT sensors** for real-time waste tracking and automation.
